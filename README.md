# ChristmasPong
A Pong game with the style of Christmas. Ray traced attempt at a 24 hour game jam.
Didn't do very well at the final 24 hour cut off; but, was able to see data pushes 
to the GPU. Another thing to note is that the default OSX GLUT is really bad, but you
don't have to work at all for mac windowing system so that's nice.
